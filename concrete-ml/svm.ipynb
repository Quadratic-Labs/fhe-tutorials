    "#### Second, we have a Concrete-ML implementation,which behaves just like the scikit-learn one.\n",

    "\n",
    "Concrete-ML prediction accuracy is slightly under scikit-learn implementation. This is because of [quantization](https://docs.zama.ai/concrete-ml/advanced-topics/quantization): number precision needs to be fixed-size for the model to be evaluated in FHE. This can be alleviated down to where the accuracy difference is none or negligible.\n",

    "#### Execution time\n",
    "\n",
    "The execution is slower with Concrete-ML, especially when compiling the model. Enabling and using encryption indeed uses a lot more resources than training and using a model using plain data.

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "Setting up FHE with Concrete-ML on a LinearSVC model is very simple, in the regard that Concrete-ML provides an implementation of the [scikit-learn LinearSVC interface](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.svm.LinearSVC.html). As a matter of fact, a working FHE model can be setup with just a few lines of code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Setting up a model with FHE benefits nonetheless from some additional work. For LinearSVC models, the main point is to select a relevant bit-size for [quantizing](https://docs.zama.ai/concrete-ml/advanced-topics/quantization) the model. Some additional tools can smooth up the development workflow, such as alleviating the [compilation](https://docs.zama.ai/concrete-ml/advanced-topics/compilation) time by making use of the [virtual library](https://docs.zama.ai/concrete-ml/advanced-topics/compilation#simulation-with-the-virtual-library) \n",
    "\n",
    "Once the model is carefully trained and quantized, it is ready to be deployed and used in production. Here are some useful links that cover this subject:\n",
